TIL - more about health literacy

What I did
- looking for abroad health literacy literature to understand digital health literacy more deeper
- but their results and conclusion is not something special
- discuss with my coworker who managed CDSS project. clinical .. what was the full-term? Clinical Decision Support System
- CDSS was also interesting, that was related to machine learning algorithm.
- AI can classify the kind of drugs, volume, time, etc..

Feeling
- I was kind of tired, but not bad.
- I did overtime work first time after I came here, Kangbuk hospital.
